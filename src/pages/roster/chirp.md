Based in Ann Arbor, MI, Chirp is a four-piece band that does their fair share of genre-hopping. Often playing in the styles of progressive rock/funk and jazz-fusion, their sound maintains a melodic center. The group features a wide array of originals and covers in their live sets and puts together dynamic, high-energy shows. Though their music ties in many technical elements, an equal emphasis is put on grooving and keeping people moving. Chirp takes influence from Snarky Puppy, Steely Dan, Led Zeppelin, James Brown, Yes, Daft Punk, Vulfpeck, and The Beatles to name a few.

Chirp has been hard at work since their formation in 2015, playing over 200 shows in 3 years. Their fresh sound has taken them touring across the Midwest to play a large variety of venues and festivals. Chirp released their self-titled debut studio album in March 2019 as well as three live-recorded EPs: "Live from Brownstown" (in-studio, 2016), "Live at Willis Sound" (in-studio, 2017), and “Live at Ann Arbor Summer Festival” (2018). All of which have been met with great reception and have helped along with live performances to build an extremely enthusiastic fan base. Chirp is Jay Frydenlund, Brian Long, Ken Ball, and John Gorine.
